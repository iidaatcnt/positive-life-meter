# Positive Life Meter

This is a web application that visualizes your remaining life time to help you live a more fulfilling life.

## Overview

By inputting your date of birth, gender, and lifestyle factors (smoking, exercise, diet, etc.), this application calculates your estimated life expectancy and displays your remaining life in real-time. The goal is to raise awareness of healthy lifestyle habits by visually grasping the impact of daily actions on your lifespan.

## Features

- **Lifestyle Factors:** Set factors such as smoking, exercise habits, diet, alcohol consumption, stress, and social connections.

- **Real-time Remaining Time Display:** The remaining time, calculated by subtracting your current age from your estimated life expectancy, is displayed in a real-time countdown of years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
- **Impact of Actions on Lifespan:** You can simulate how positive actions (e.g., exercise, healthy eating) and negative actions (e.g., smoking, excessive drinking) affect your remaining time.
- **Visual Progress:** The percentage of remaining time is displayed visually with a progress bar.
